CF_dataset:
Time course of recurrent exc. connection fraction for diffusive h. and Gauss. conn. profile.

CF_dataset_non_diff:
Time course of recurrent exc. connection fraction for non-diffusive h. and Gauss. conn. profile.

CF_dataset_non_diff_no_topology:
Time course of recurrent exc. connection fraction for non-diffusive h. and uniform conn. profile.

CF_dataset_no_topology:
Time course of recurrent exc. connection fraction for diffusive h. and uniform conn. profile.

complete_diff_long:
1500s simulation, completely using diffusive homeostasis.

complete_diff_long_small_tau:
1500s simulation, completely using diffusive homeostasis, but using a 1000-fold smaller time constant for
threshold adaptation.

complete_diff_prepostnorm:
1000s simulation, settings as for complete_diff_long, but recording exc. weights before and after each normalization process.

complete_instant_diff_long:
1500s simulation, completely using instantaneous diffusion for diff. hom.

complete_non_diff_long:
1500s simulation, completely using non-diff. hom.

complete_non_diff_prepostnorm:
As complete_diff_prepostnorm, but only using non-diff hom.

Diff_constant_test_matrix_solve_correlation:
Set of simulations with different diffusion constants used for calculating the corr. coeff. between simulated and predicted firing rates.

Diff_topology_versions:
4 simulations with all possible diff/non-diff h., Gaussian/uniform connection profile
combinations.

Diffusion_constant_test_neumann:
Simulations testing different diffusion constants, used for analyzing the dependence of width and skewness
of the firing rate dist. on the diffusion constant.

ext_input_switch:
Tests the response of the network onto subgroups of excitatory neurons receiving elevated external input

ext_input_switch_spread_source:
Same as previous, but using circular shaped, non-point-like nNOS influx kernels.

regular_grid_neumann:
Simulates a network where excitatory neurons are placed on a regular square grid. Shows
that the width of the firing rate distribution can be affected by the spatial setup of
the neurons.

spiketime_dataset_diff:
Spiketime data taken from a set of simulations, only using diff. hom.

spiketime_dataset_instant_diffusion:
Same as above, but with instantaneous diffusion only.

spiketime_dataset_non_diff:
See above.

tau_theta_sweep:
A simulation in which the time constant of threshold adaptation (for diffusive homeostasis)
was stepwise increased to examine its effect on the amplitude and frequency of the noise-
induced oscillations that we observed.

weights_spiketimes_dataset_diff/non_diff:
Dataset of multiple simulations, where terminal weights and spiketimes were recorded.
