Before running the plotting scripts,
run setup_env_install_modules.py to install
the "custom_modules" package, tqdm and the powerlaw package.

You will be asked to specify a folder for storing the simulation data
and for storing the generated figures. Please make sure to include a
"/" at the end of the chosen path.

Furthermore, the following packages are used:
brian 
numpy/scipy
matplotlib


Each figure in the latex code has a reference to the plotting script that generates the graphics of the figure.
Each plotting script contains a list of code that needs to be run before running the plotting script.

When running a simulation script, you can either directly run the python script starting with "SORN_...", or run the "run_sims.py" script in the same folder. In some cases, this will then subsequently execute multiple simulation runs, e.g. if the simulation is meant to be run with different values of a parameter.

If needed, change key parameters of the simulation by altering the parameters.py file in the same folder.
